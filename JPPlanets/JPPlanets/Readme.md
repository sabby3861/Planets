## Future Improvements ##


### Currently we only call first page of planets API, we can call for all the pages one by one, using pull do download and providing the page number to download the data, where we can pass the index of page.  Currently used enum, which has the url string. We can impelemt function there to inpur page number and create the string url by appending that number.
### We can also show another informations like Residents, population so on.
### We can implement navigation to show corresponding items, like residents for example, while clicking any plant name.
### We can add more test cases, like for presenter layer, currently I have added only 2 test cases.
